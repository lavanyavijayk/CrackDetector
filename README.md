# Crack Detection

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Crack Detection** using a dataset of labeled images to build and evaluate a machine learning model. The dataset includes a total of 32,107 images categorized into cracks and no-cracks. The aim is to automate the detection of cracks, which can have significant applications in structural health monitoring.
